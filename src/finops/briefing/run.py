"""The overnight run: scan, review, rank, draft, deliver.

Runs on a schedule, writes the brief where the dashboard can serve it, and
pushes to Slack, Teams and email ONLY where someone opted in. The dashboard is
the primary surface and always gets the brief; the push channels are a
subscription, because a cost tool that starts messaging a channel nobody asked
it to message gets muted once and never read again.

TWO THINGS THIS DELIBERATELY WILL NOT DO WITHOUT BEING ASKED:

  - Call Cost Explorer. Every CE request bills the account it runs in. An
    overnight job that quietly adds a recurring line to the customer's own bill
    is not something to opt people into. The resource audit uses describe calls,
    which are free.
  - Call a language model. The critique pass has an LLM tier that spends the
    operator's own Anthropic tokens. Overnight, unattended, on a loop, that is a
    bill rather than a feature, so it stays off unless explicitly enabled.

Failure posture: a brief that half-ran is still worth reading, so a provider
that dies contributes a line to `gaps` rather than killing the run. A brief that
silently omitted a region is the thing to avoid.
