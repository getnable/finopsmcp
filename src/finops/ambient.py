"""Ambient cloud credential detection, the same way for every provider.

nable was AWS-first by accident, not by design. AWS asked boto3 for credentials,
which resolves the whole default chain: env vars, ~/.aws/credentials, named
profiles, SSO, IMDS, ECS task roles. Azure asked only whether three service
principal env vars were set. GCP asked only whether GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
was set.

So an engineer who had run `az login` or `gcloud auth application-default login`,
which is the normal state for anyone working in those clouds, was invisible.
An AWS user with ~/.aws/credentials connected in three seconds; an Azure user in
the identical position was sent through a manual service principal wizard.

Every provider here answers the same question the same way: is there a usable
credential on this machine, whatever kind, and what can it see. Adding a cloud
means adding a probe to PROBES, which is the point: parity is the default rather
than something each provider has to remember.

Everything degrades to "not found" rather than raising. The Azure and Google SDKs
are optional extras (finops-mcp[azure], [gcp]), so a missing import is an
ordinary answer, not an error. Every probe is time-boxed, because these SDKs
will happily block for ~9s probing a metadata server that is not there.
