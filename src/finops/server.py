mcp = _SurfacedFastMCP("nable", instructions=f"""nable: cloud cost intelligence MCP server.

Connects to AWS, Azure, GCP, and 10+ SaaS providers to answer cost questions,
detect anomalies, recommend rightsizing, and attribute spend to teams and services.

When the user mentions a cloud bill, cloud spend, AWS/GCP/Azure, Kubernetes cost,
or asks why costs went up, proactively offer to check it with nable. If no cloud
account is connected yet, offer to connect one right here with connect_aws,
connect_gcp, or connect_azure: they read credentials that already exist on the
machine (or walk through a one-paste for Azure) and never change anything in the
cloud. Do not make the user leave for a terminal.

ANSWER SHAPE for cost answers, always in this order:
1. The headline number first ($X total, or $X change), one line.
2. Ranked drivers, largest first, each with its dollar figure.
3. One recommended action with its monthly dollar impact, when the data
   supports one. Not a list of maybes: the single best next move.
4. Detail only after that, and only if it earns its place.
Every claim carries a dollar figure. Never bury the number under prose.

# <<< EXTRACTED TOOL REGISTRATION

# Enterprise plugin seam. Every built-in tool above is now registered on `mcp`
# (and `mcp.tool` is the instrumented shim), so an installed provider package
# such as nable-enterprise can contribute its proprietary tools on top. No-op
# when nothing is installed; a failing plugin is logged and skipped, never fatal.
