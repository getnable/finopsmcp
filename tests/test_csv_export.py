"""The CSV export, driven through the real tool.

This file used to test a copy of the tool instead of the tool. Its helper said so
in its own docstring: "Replicate the CSV-writing logic from export_cost_report_csv
so we can test the output format without needing a live AWS connection." Every
test called that helper, so the file asserted that a fixture it had just written
matched what it had just written, and one test wrote a two-row CSV inline and
asserted the file existed, which tests `open`.

Meanwhile the tool itself began with an import of
`scan_spot_adoption_opportunities`, a function that has never existed anywhere in
the package, and raised ImportError on every call it ever received. Seven green
tests, one dead tool, no contradiction, because the two had nothing to do with
each other.

The lesson is not "mock less". It is that a test which re-implements its subject
cannot fail for any reason the subject can fail for. So every test here calls
`export_cost_report_csv`. AWS is replaced at `sweep.build_specs`, the boundary
where our code hands off to boto3, and every line above it is the real one.
