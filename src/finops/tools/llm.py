    the model; Copilot, Codex, Cursor, and Devin resolve to the tool), sizes each
    high/medium/low by diff, and joins LLM spend by model. The line it produces:

    actually used comes back in the "unit" field of the result.

    ["owner/name"]. Read-only.

    Ranked, dollar-quantified plan to cut your AI/LLM bill, across OpenAI,

    This is the OpenRouter question answered as analysis, not a proxy: the
    cheapest way to get the same output. It decomposes spend into its real
    driver (model choice vs token size vs request volume) and returns the
    levers ranked by monthly dollars saved:

      - Model routing: move lower-complexity calls to a cheaper sibling model
        (priced from real input/output ratios, not a guessed percentage)
      - Prompt caching: raise your Anthropic cache hit rate so repeated input

      - Output reduction: trim verbose responses (output is the pricier side)
      - Error reduction: stop paying for failed requests
      - Model consolidation: collapse model sprawl into clear tiers

    Only levers with a grounded basis carry a savings number; governance levers
    are listed without inflating the headline. Output-trim savings are skipped
