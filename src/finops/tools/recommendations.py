Extracted verbatim from server.py (the 14k-line monolith) as the first step of
splitting tools into per-family modules. These drive the savings ledger, the
propose-only recommendation lifecycle (act-on / dismiss / verify), the
context-memory loop (remember / recall / forget an intentional finding), and the
learning-quality readouts. They register against the shared, telemetry-wrapped
`mcp` instance the moment server.py imports this module, so behavior is identical
