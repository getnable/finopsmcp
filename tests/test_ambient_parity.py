"""Every cloud answers "is there a credential here" the same way.

nable was AWS-first by accident. AWS asked boto3, which resolves the whole
default chain (env, ~/.aws/credentials, profiles, SSO, IMDS, ECS roles). Azure
asked only whether three service-principal env vars were set. GCP asked only
whether GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS was set.

The effect on a real person: an engineer with `~/.aws/credentials` connected in
three seconds, while an engineer who had run `az login` or
`gcloud auth application-default login` (the normal state in those clouds) read
as unconfigured and was pushed through a manual service-principal wizard. The one
user who connected on 2026-07-31 connected Azure, twice, and never saw a number.

These tests pin the parity itself, not three separate behaviours, so a fourth
cloud cannot quietly ship with a weaker check.
