    Forecast future cloud spend using Holt-Winters time-series modelling.

    Automatically tunes forecast parameters (alpha/beta/gamma) to your account's
    historical spend patterns and returns a daily point forecast with 80%
    prediction intervals.

    Args:
        account_id:   AWS account ID (auto-discovered from STS if not provided)
        service:      specific service to forecast (e.g. "EC2", "RDS"), omit for total
        horizon_days: number of days to forecast (default 30)
        history_days: days of history to fit the model (default 90, need ≥14)

    Returns forecast including method used, MAPE accuracy %, monthly projection,
    and day-by-day point/lower/upper estimates.
    Examples:
        - "Forecast our AWS spend for next month"
        - "Where will EC2 costs be in 60 days?"
