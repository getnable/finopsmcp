## Security Model

- Credentials are encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC) and stored in your OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, libsecret on Linux)
- Credentials never leave your machine
- All cloud provider API calls are read-only by default
- License keys are signed with HMAC-SHA256
- No telemetry contains credentials or cost data -- only anonymous install IDs and event names
