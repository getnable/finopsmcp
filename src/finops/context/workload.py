"""Is this thing production, or is it somewhere people are allowed to make a mess?

A sandbox where somebody is deliberately hammering an encoder for a week and a
production fleet quietly burning money look identical to a statistical detector.
Both are spend above a baseline. Only one of them is a problem, and only one of
them should ever receive a pull request.

Everything here reads signals the account already carries: tags, the account or
subscription name, the Kubernetes namespace, and the resource's own name. Nobody
is asked to declare anything, because the shops most likely to have this problem
are the least likely to have filled in a policy file.

The asymmetry is deliberate and is the whole safety argument:

    positive evidence of non-production  ->  suppress the action
    anything else, including unknown     ->  behave exactly as before

We never enable an action on a guess. We only ever hold one back, and only when
something in the account actually said "this is not production". An untagged
estate is therefore no worse off than it is today, which is the property that
lets this ship on by default.

`unknown` is a real answer and is kept distinct from `prod` all the way out to
the caller. A classifier that reports its guesses as facts is how "failed read
becomes a number" gets into a product, and callers need to be able to say "no
signal" rather than "production".

The org model (finops.org) comes first when the caller names an account or a
namespace: an environment a human confirmed for it is the answer, before any
of the signals below. An environment fact nobody has confirmed is a guess,
and product-wide a nonprod label is what makes a thing eligible for
schedules and spot, so a guess may only move a result toward "prod" or
"unknown", never toward "nonprod".

    Ephemeral beats production outright, because "ephemeral" describes an
