"""The tightest credential each billing source can be given, and what nable calls with it.

Asked on r/selfhosted, 2026-08-08: can the scope be reduced down to billing? For
some providers, yes, exactly. For others the honest answer is no, and the useful
thing is to say which is which rather than claim least privilege everywhere and
be wrong in the one place it matters.

So every entry carries a grade:

  scoped   The provider has a billing-specific permission and nable uses exactly
           it. A leaked credential reads billing and nothing else.
  inventory
           Read-only, but wider than billing: the credential lists and describes
           resources and reads their metrics. It can change nothing. It reads
           resource names, sizes and settings, and on AWS those settings include
           Lambda and ECS environment variables, which can hold secrets.
  role     No per-key scope, but you can put the key behind a limited role or
           user. Tight in the end, though it is your role assignment doing the
           work, not the key itself.
  account  The provider offers nothing narrower. A leaked credential is as
           powerful as the account it was minted from. Stated plainly, because
           an operator deciding whether to install this deserves to know.

`gap` is where we know a narrower path exists that nable does not use yet. It is
a work list kept in the open, not a footnote: a manifest that only records good
news is marketing.

This is the single source for `nable connect --scopes`, the setup hints, and the
trust page. A test asserts every registered billing source has an entry, so a
new connector cannot ship with its blast radius undocumented.
