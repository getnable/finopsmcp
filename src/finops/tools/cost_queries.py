        paying_customers:   Number of paying customers / accounts

        notes:              Free-text context, e.g. "Post Series A, hired 8 engineers"
        metric_date:        Date these metrics apply to (YYYY-MM-DD). Defaults to today.
        cash_on_hand_usd:   Cash in the bank, in USD. Powers runway in get_unit_economics().

    Slice cloud cost any way you want. This is the flexible, moldable cost query:
    group and filter by ANY combination of dimensions, over any date range, instead
    of a fixed set of canned reports. Returns both the numbers and a `card` describing
    how to chart them (which the UI can render and pin to the dashboard).

    Dimensions (group by, up to 3): ServiceName, ServiceCategory, ProviderName,
    RegionId, RegionName, SubAccountId, SubAccountName, ResourceId, ResourceName,
    ResourceType, ChargeCategory, ChargeDescription, CommitmentDiscountId,
    CommitmentDiscountType, plus "date" (a time series, use granularity) and
    "Tags[<key>]" for any tag (e.g. "Tags[team]"). For line-item detail (AWS only,
    needs CUR + Athena set up): "usage_type", "instance_type", "resource_id" — using
    any of these auto-routes the query to the CUR pushdown.

    filters / exclusions: each is {dimension, op, values}. op is one of eq, in, neq,
    not_in, contains, regex. filters keep matching rows; exclusions drop matching rows.
    Example "EC2 by region last 90 days, excluding Savings Plan credits":
      dimensions=["RegionId"], filters=[{"dimension":"ServiceName","op":"eq","values":["Amazon EC2"]}],
      exclusions=[{"dimension":"ChargeCategory","op":"in","values":["Credit"]}], metric="EffectiveCost"

    metric: BilledCost | EffectiveCost (amortized, default) | ListCost.
    granularity: TOTAL | DAILY | MONTHLY (only matters when "date" is a dimension).
    order_by: "metric" (default, descending) or a dimension name.
    start_date / end_date: YYYY-MM-DD (default last 30 days). provider: aws|azure|gcp (default all).
    via: "auto" (default; CUR only when a line-item dimension is requested), "focus", or "cur".

        metric: "cost" (default) or another supported metric.

        order_by: Sort field, defaults to the metric descending.

        start_date: ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD). Defaults to 30 days ago.
