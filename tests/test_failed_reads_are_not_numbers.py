"""A caught exception must not become a dollar figure. Ratchet, not a rule.

Why this file exists, stated plainly: one defect shape accounted for more of this
codebase's wrong numbers than any other, and fixing instances of it did not stop
it recurring.

    except Exception:
        return 0.0

Every one of these reads as a fact. Not "we could not look", but "it is zero",
and zero is never the neutral answer for a cost tool. It is the most alarming
reading available:

  - a CloudWatch metric that threw became 0.000 GB/day, so every NAT gateway in
    the region was reported idle the moment CloudWatch was unreachable
  - a NetworkOut read that threw became 0.0 bytes, which fell straight into the
    guard that spares network-bound hosts, so the failure DISABLED the check
    that would have saved a Kafka broker from a terminate suggestion
  - a DENIED Savings Plans coverage call became 0% coverage, and 0% coverage is
    the trigger for a purchase, so a missing IAM permission produced advice to
    commit $5,940 a month
  - a failed snapshot query became a $0 week, posted to a team's Slack as
    "Weekly cost: $0 (+0.0% vs last week)" and reported as sent successfully

Six of these were fixed by hand. That is the problem: they were fixed as
instances. A rule in a document ("don't return 0.0 on error") does not fail
anything, and the seventh gets written next week.

So this is a ceiling that can only come down. The allowlist below is the exact
set that existed when it was written. A new one fails immediately. Fixing one and
leaving its entry here ALSO fails, so the list cannot rot into a permanent
exemption: it has to shrink as the work gets done, and when it is empty this file
becomes a plain prohibition.

Keyed on (file, name), never on line numbers. A test in this repo already pinned
a fix by line number once, and a mutation that moved the code one line up
satisfied it while breaking the property.

Scope note: only zeros that flow into money or a percentage are counted. A
counter defaulting to 0 after a failed listing is fine and there are 39 of those;
they are not what puts a wrong figure in front of a customer.
