"""Blocking work on the event loop, and the deadlines it quietly disarms.

Why this file exists, stated plainly: nable advertises three separate deadlines
around provider calls, and on the provider that matters most none of them can
fire. `asyncio.wait_for` only cancels a coroutine that suspends. A coroutine that
calls a synchronous SDK function holds the single event-loop thread for the whole
call, so the timer callback that would cancel it cannot be dispatched until the
call has already finished. The timeout still raises, just far too late, and by
then the number it was protecting has already cost the user the wall clock it was
supposed to bound. The same mechanic turns `asyncio.gather` over blocking
coroutines into a plain for-loop: three providers "in parallel" is the sum of
their latencies, not the max.

The seam is the provider SDK, not our code. Nothing below replaces a nable
function with a stub. The azure.identity credential, the google.auth default
credential, boto3.client and the boto3 Session are faked at the point where they
would leave the machine, each one made to take a measured amount of time the way
a real STS or ARM round trip does. Everything between that boundary and the
assertion is the real thing: the real probe bodies, the real memoisation, the
real `_active` gather, the real `_fetch_costs_cached` deadline, the real
`check_connector_health` probe fan-out, the real `get_engine` publish order.

What these tests measure is therefore not "is the code slow". It is "can the loop
run anything else while this is in flight", which is the property every deadline
in the async layer is built on. The wall-clock thresholds are set with roughly a
2x margin either side so a loaded machine cannot flip them.

Every test here is a red test: it fails against the code as it stands today, and
each docstring says what a customer sees because of it.
