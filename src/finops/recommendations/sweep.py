"""One cost sweep, shared by every tool that reports savings.

Why this module exists, stated plainly: the sweep that runs 21 scanners and
normalises their output into findings existed three times. run_full_cost_audit
had the maintained copy. export_cost_report_csv and publish_cost_report_to_notion
had forks of an older version, and the forks had drifted:

  - Both imported `scan_spot_adoption_opportunities`, a name that has never
    existed in recommendations.spot_adoption. The import sits above the scanner
    dispatch, so BOTH TOOLS RAISED ImportError on every single invocation. Not
    degraded, not partial: dead, for as long as the fork has existed.
  - Both called the spot scanner as `f(aws_client=aws, regions=regions)`, but
    the real function takes only `regions`. Fixing the name alone would have
    swapped ImportError for TypeError.
  - Both gathered the scanners as bare coroutines on the running event loop, so
    they ran back to back and blocked it. The audit moved to threads with a
    deadline; the forks never got that.
  - Neither attached `resource_id`, so neither could collapse mutually exclusive
    fixes on one resource. The 141-156% overstatement that was fixed in the audit
    was still live in both exports.

Four defects, one cause: the same logic written down three times. So it is
written down once here, and the three tools call it. A fourth caller cannot
drift because there is nothing left to drift from.

Nothing in this module talks to finops.server, so it is importable from any tool
module without the import cycle that shape usually brings.
