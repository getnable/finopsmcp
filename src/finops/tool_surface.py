"""
Connection-aware tool surface: which of the ~191 registered tools get ADVERTISED
to the model.

Every tool definition advertised over tools/list rides in the model's context on
every message, so a user pays recurring tokens for tools they cannot use: an
AWS-only machine has no use for the Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, or Databricks tools,
and models pick tools worse as the surface grows. This module maps every tool to
exactly one family and decides, from cheap LOCAL signals only, which families are
worth advertising right now.

Advertisement-only: nothing here unregisters a tool. The MCP call path resolves
tools against the registry, not the advertised list (verified on mcp 1.27.2), so
a hidden tool called by name still runs. That keeps the in-chat connect flow
intact: connect_aws works, then the AWS tools are usable immediately and appear
in the list after a tools/list_changed notification or an editor restart.

Rules:
  - core is always advertised, and is deliberately SMALL: only what is useful
    with zero providers connected (connect_*, status/diagnosis, the local agent
    budget, the preflight guard). ~20 tools.
  - cost holds the cross-provider cost/report/recommendation tools. They are not
    provider-specific, but every one needs a data source, so they are advertised
    only once some provider family is connected. On a fresh machine they would
    each answer "no accounts connected", which is pure context tax on precisely
    the user who has not connected yet.
  - a provider family is advertised when local signals say it is connected
    (env vars first, then vault key names, then accounts.yaml / kubeconfig).
    Detection never touches the network and is cached ~30s.
  - llm is advertised when LLM keys exist OR aws is connected, mirroring the
    capabilities gate: Bedrock token tools work off the AWS account alone.
  - FINOPS_ALL_TOOLS=1 (the existing escape hatch) and demo mode advertise
    everything.
  - an unmapped tool advertises with a warning (fail open); the completeness
    test in tests/test_tool_surface.py is the real enforcement, so a new tool
    that nobody classifies fails CI instead of silently hiding.

# ── the tier map (the funnel) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Family answers "can this user use it at all". Tier answers a different
# question: should the model see it BEFORE it knows what it is looking for.
#
# Filtering by family narrowed the surface but left it flat. Measured on main:
# 198 advertised tools, ~46,700 tokens a message, and 59 of those tools have
# cost/spend/bill in the name. That is a third of the surface spent on doors into
# one question. get_cost_summary, get_costs_by_service, get_top_cost_drivers,
# get_cost_trends, get_service_cost and get_total_spend_all_sources are not six
# capabilities, they are six phrasings, and the model is left guessing between
# them instead of choosing between things it can actually do.
#
#   TIER 1  The front door: one way in per question a user actually asks.
#           Advertised, subject to the family gate.
#   TIER 2  Everything else. Registered, callable by name, not advertised.
#           Reached because tier 1 named it in a response.
#   TIER 3  Forensics and long-tail leaves. Same advertisement rule as tier 2,
#           called out separately because these are the expensive, precise ones
#           that should only ever be reached with a handle from the layer above.
#
# Unlisted means tier 2, and that default is deliberate. For families an unmapped
# tool fails OPEN (advertised, noisy, caught by a test). For tiers it fails SHUT,
# because a new tool quietly joining the front door is the failure that costs
# every user tokens on every message. The guard that matters is not completeness,
# it is the budget test in tests/test_tool_tiers.py: the front door has a token
# ceiling and CI fails when it creeps.
