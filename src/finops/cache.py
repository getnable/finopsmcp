"""
Read-through TTL cache for cost data.

In the MCP model, an agentic session asks the same cost question several times
while cross-referencing. Without caching, every call re-hits the cloud billing
API, and AWS Cost Explorer bills $0.01 per request, so one conversation can
quietly run up real API cost. This cache makes the first call fetch and every
repeat within the TTL free.

It is passive by design. Entries are populated on read and served until they
expire. There is no timer, no polling, no background refresh. It can only ever
call the underlying API when a caller asks and the stored copy is missing or
stale, so it cannot "call the API every few seconds" on its own.

Cost data (long TTL) is additionally persisted to a small on-disk store, so a
restart, a redeploy, or simply the next day's first query serves the prior fetch
instead of going back to Cost Explorer. Short-lived entries (Kubernetes state)
stay in memory only. Persistence is strictly best-effort: any disk problem
degrades to memory-only, never to wrong data.

TTLs are tuned to how fast the source actually changes:
  - AWS Cost Explorer / CUR refresh about 3x/day at daily granularity, so 12h
    is safe and costs nothing in accuracy
  - Kubernetes cluster state moves faster, so a few minutes
