"""When Cost Explorer is worth paying for, and the policy that decides.

CE stays: it is the on-ramp that turns credentials somebody already has into a
real number in a minute. What it is not worth is being called when unnecessary —
when the billing export can answer the same question for free and in more
detail, or in unattended work where the per-request charge repeats on a timer.

These tests are written to BREAK the policy, not to demonstrate it.
