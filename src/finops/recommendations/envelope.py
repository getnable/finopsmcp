"""
Trust envelope for recommendations.

Every finding is one of two kinds, decided by the STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE behind it,
never by how big the dollar number is:

  - "recommendation": we measured it. Precise dollar figure, a safe action, and a
    post-action verifier can later confirm the saving actually landed. We stake the
    word "recommend" on it.
  - "investigation": we noticed a real signal but cannot confirm it yet (a proxy, a
    heuristic, missing tags or data). NO precise dollar claim, only an
    order-of-magnitude band, and the first step is always how to get to certainty.
    The agent can run the investigation and graduate it into a recommendation.

A low-confidence "recommendation" is impossible by construction: classify() routes
anything not backed by measured evidence to "investigation", and Finding.to_dict()
strips any precise figure off an investigation. That is the whole point: we never
put a precise number on something we did not measure.
