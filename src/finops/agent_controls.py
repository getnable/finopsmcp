"""Agent cost controls: the pure helpers behind the pre-action gate.

An agent calls `check_action_policy` before it acts. These functions add the parts
that make the verdict useful in the agent's loop: a cheaper alternative when one
genuinely exists, the remediation posture (propose by default; auto is a later
opt-in mode), and a data-age helper so a budget verdict can say how fresh it is.

Pure and import-light on purpose: no server or DB import here, so it stays testable
in environments where the full MCP server import cannot load.
