"""The funnel: advertise the front door, keep everything else callable.

Family filtering narrowed the surface but left it flat. 198 tools, ~46,700
tokens a message, 59 of them with cost/spend/bill in the name. Tiering advertises
only the entry points.

Two things have to stay true or this is a regression rather than a feature:
the hidden tools must still run, and the front door must not creep back into a
pile. The budget test below is the one that matters most, because creep is
gradual and nobody notices a surface growing 300 tokens at a time.
