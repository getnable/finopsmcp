"""nable is read-only and propose-only. These tests enforce it structurally.

Two shipped defects motivated this file:

  1. `cleanup_idle_resources` was advertised to every MCP client with
     readOnlyHint=True / destructiveHint=False while its implementation called
     ec2.delete_volume, ec2.terminate_instances, ec2.release_address,
     ec2.delete_snapshot and elbv2.delete_load_balancer. A client configured to
     auto-approve read-only tools had silently granted mass deletion.
  2. The upgrade-nudge telemetry event sent `savings_found_monthly` and
     `roi_multiple` (= savings / 49, so the figure was recoverable either way)
     while telemetry.py's own "What we never collect" list promises "Cost
     figures or billing data".

Neither would have been caught by a test of the changed function, because in
both cases the function was fine and the CALL SITE was the bug. So these scan
the whole package instead: add a mutating cloud call or a cost-shaped telemetry
key anywhere and one of these fails.
