"""
End-to-end rightsizing remediation via Terraform PR.

Flow:
  1. Load open rightsizing recommendations from the DB (by ID or all open).
  2. For each rec, resolve the Terraform resource in the IaC repo.
  3. Patch the instance_type / instance_class in the .tf file on disk.
  4. Create a git branch, commit, push.
  5. Open a GitHub PR with a cost impact summary, requesting reviews from the
     approval chain the org model confirmed for rightsizing there (and a place
     for the change ticket's link when that chain requires one).
  6. Mark recommendations as acted_on, storing the PR URL.

Supported resource types:
  aws_instance, aws_db_instance, aws_rds_cluster_instance,
  aws_elasticache_cluster, aws_elasticache_replication_group, aws_redshift_cluster

Each recommendation must carry recommended_config with:
  - instance_type  (or instance_class / node_type depending on resource type)
  - tf_resource_type   e.g. "aws_instance"
  - tf_resource_name   e.g. "api_server"
  - from_instance_type (the current type, for PR description)

      3. recommended_config stored in DB — if previously set

        tf_dir:              Path to the Terraform working directory.
        github_repo:         "owner/repo" for the GitHub PR. Optional when patch_only=True.
        recommendation_ids:  IDs to act on. If None, uses all open rightsizing recs.

                             Each entry: {recommendation_id, tf_resource_type, tf_resource_name}.
        branch:              Git branch to create. Defaults to "fix/rightsizing".
        base_branch:         PR target branch. Defaults to "main".
        pr_title:            PR title. Auto-generated if not provided.

        patch_only:          Write files locally but skip git and GitHub PR creation.
                             Useful when the user manages their own git workflow.

    # The kill switch is checked HERE, at the function that does the writing,

    # the Slack approval handler did not, so approving a rightsizing action in
    # Slack rewrote the customer's Terraform and pushed a branch with the switch
    # off. That is the same shape as the auth kill switch that considered only
    # one login method: a gate that every caller must remember is a gate that
    # one caller will forget, and the one that forgot was the interactive path
    # where a human thought they were just clicking approve.
    #
    # dry_run and patch_only are BOTH exempt, and getting that wrong is how this
    # comment earned its length. The gate's scope, stated in gate.py, is "may
    # nable push a branch and open a pull request in our repositories at all" —
    # an outward question about a remote. patch_only answers it by never asking:
    # it returns before any git, subprocess or HTTP call in this function, into a
    # directory the caller named explicitly with tf_dir.

    # I first gated patch_only anyway, reasoning that it still edits the working
    # tree. That made disabled_response() a liar: its own message offers
    # patch_only as the way to proceed, so a user following the refusal verbatim
    # hit the same refusal. Three pre-existing tests caught it. Gating the escape
    # hatch the refusal recommends is exactly the bug the paragraph above warns
    # about, committed one paragraph later.
