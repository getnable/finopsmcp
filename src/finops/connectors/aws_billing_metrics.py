"""What the bill looks like right now, from the cheapest AWS source there is.

THE GAP THIS FILLS

The Cost and Usage Report is the right source for history: complete, itemised,
and cheap to read out of the customer's own bucket (connectors/cur_s3.py). It
has one weakness, and it is structural rather than fixable. AWS delivers CUR
files up to 24 hours behind, and the current day is always partial. So a
dashboard built only on the CUR is correct and slightly behind, and the first
question anyone asks is "what about today".

Cost Explorer answers that for $0.01 a question. CloudWatch answers it for a
small fraction of a cent. AWS publishes AWS/Billing EstimatedCharges into
CloudWatch metrics, and the read here is one GetMetricData call for the total
plus one metric per service. GetMetricData is billed at $0.01 per 1,000
metrics with no free tier (AWS Price List, CW:GMD-Metrics); only the
list_metrics discovery call falls in CloudWatch's free request tier. That is
the reason this module exists: it closes the freshness gap for about a
hundredth of what Cost Explorer charges per question.

WHAT THIS IS NOT

An estimate, and labelled one everywhere it surfaces. Specifically:

  - Month to date and CUMULATIVE, not daily. Today's spend is a difference
    between two datapoints, so it inherits both of their errors.
  - Refreshed roughly every six hours, not continuously.
  - Coarse. Service and linked account, no region, no resource, no tags.
  - Published only in us-east-1, whatever regions the spend is actually in.
  - Excludes some credits and refunds that land on the final invoice.

So it never writes to cost_snapshots. Measured history and a provisional
estimate are different kinds of fact, and the moment they share a table
somebody sums them. The CUR is what the bill WAS; this is what AWS currently
THINKS the bill will be. Callers get both, and get told which is which.

REQUIRES ONE ACCOUNT SETTING

AWS only publishes these metrics once billing alerts are switched on
(Billing console, Billing Preferences, "Receive CloudWatch billing alerts").
It is a checkbox and it is free, but until it is ticked the namespace is empty.
unavailable() says exactly that rather than reporting no spend, because a
missing setting that reads as $0.00 is the defect this codebase keeps finding.
