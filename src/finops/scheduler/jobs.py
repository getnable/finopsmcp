"""The work: take a snapshot, detect anomalies, send a digest. On demand.

This module is the WHAT. It no longer contains the WHEN.

Every function here runs because something asked it to, right then: an MCP tool
("take a cost snapshot now", "send the digest now"), a CLI command, or the
hosted cron. The cron itself, the nine registrations and the cross-host lock
that stops two boxes double-sending, moved to nable-enterprise on 2026-08-15,
because running unattended forever is the hosted product and answering a
question is the open one.

What that buys the open package, beyond tidiness: nothing here ever sets the
unattended mark, so an Apache-2.0 install has no path that can reach a billed
Cost Explorer request with nobody watching. Not "is discouraged from" — has no
path. finops.billing_access still holds the policy and the single permitted
client construction, open, for anyone who wants to audit that claim.

The pairing to keep in mind when editing: _snapshot_all / _detect_and_alert /
_send_daily_digest do the work, run_*_now are the on-demand entry points MCP
tools call, and finops.scheduler.cron (closed) is what calls them on a timer.
