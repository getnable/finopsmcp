    Pull Google's native Recommender API cost recommendations for your GCP projects.

    This is the deeper, GCP-native counterpart to audit_gcp_waste. Instead of
    scanning resources ourselves with list-price estimates, it asks Google's own
    Recommender API, which runs ML on 8+ days of real usage and prices savings
    against your actual SKU rates (including committed-use discounts already in
    effect). It covers what the scanner can't: machine-type rightsizing,
    committed-use-discount purchases, Cloud SQL idle/overprovisioned, Cloud Run
    tuning, plus idle VMs/disks/IPs/images. Findings come back sorted by monthly
    savings and wrapped in the same trust envelope (measured -> recommendation,
    inferred -> investigation).

    Needs the Recommender API enabled (recommender.googleapis.com) and the
    Recommender Viewer role (roles/recommender.viewer). Recommendations only appear
    after Google has ~8 days of usage history.
