"""The morning brief: what nable found while you were asleep.

The product this assembles is not a list of findings. Every cost tool has one of
those and nobody reads them. It is a short, ranked set of decisions, each already
carrying the four things a reviewer needs before they will act:

  1. what is happening and what it costs        (the finding, already critiqued)
  2. what breaks if I touch it                  (the resource map)
  3. exactly what change to make                (the drafted fix)
  4. how I will know it worked                  (the verification step)

RANKING IS BY ACTIONABILITY, NOT SIZE. The morning question is "what can I safely
do today", and the biggest number is frequently the one you cannot touch without a
change window and three approvals. Ease tilts the order without dominating it: a
$300/mo volume nothing references outranks a $500/mo instance inside an
auto-scaling group, because one of them will actually get done today, while a
large enough number still wins on its own merits. Every item carries
`why_this_rank`, so the order is arguable rather than magic.

PROPOSE-ONLY. Nothing here executes, opens a PR, or files a ticket. It drafts.
The whole value is that a human reads four lines and makes one decision.
