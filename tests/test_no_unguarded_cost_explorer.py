"""No NEW module may reach Cost Explorer without saying who it is for.

Cost Explorer bills PER REQUEST against the customer's own account, so the rule
is that no unattended path calls it. The rule was enforced by everyone
remembering, and llm_costs.py did not: it made two CE calls, job_ai_monitor ran
it nightly at 05:00, and every customer was charged for a report they never
asked for.

A rule you have to remember is not a rule.

This is a BASELINE ratchet, not a clean-bill-of-health. The modules below build a
Cost Explorer client without consulting the guard TODAY. Most are reachable only
when a person asked, which is exactly what Cost Explorer is for, but that has not
been verified module by module and this test does not claim it has. What it does
is stop the set from GROWING: a new unguarded caller fails here, and the person
adding it has to say which case it is.

Shrinking this list is real work and worth doing. Adding to it should not be
possible by accident.
