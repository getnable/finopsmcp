"""
Reserved Instance & Savings Plan coverage analysis with purchase ROI.

Pulls real utilization data from AWS Cost Explorer:
  - Savings Plans utilization (coverage %, unused commitment)
  - RI utilization and coverage
  - On-demand spend that could be covered by commitments

Calculates:
  - Current waste (unused RI/SP payments)
  - Coverage gap (on-demand that commitments could cover)
  - Recommended purchase: type, term, payment, projected ROI

All figures come directly from the Cost Explorer API — no estimates.
