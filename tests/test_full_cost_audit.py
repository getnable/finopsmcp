"""run_full_cost_audit must actually run.

Two guardrails that regressed in the field:
1. Its 21 scanner imports and call signatures have to resolve. A wrong import
   name plus two wrong call signatures once aborted the entire audit before any
   scan ran, and no test caught it because none exercised the real import path.
2. The scanners must run in parallel. As bare gathered coroutines they shared one
   event loop and ran back-to-back (the sum of their times); each now runs in its
   own thread so the sweep is bounded by the slowest scanner.
