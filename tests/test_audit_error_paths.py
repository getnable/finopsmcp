"""What nable is allowed to say when a read fails.

Why this file exists, stated plainly: every dollar figure nable prints comes
from a call that can fail. CloudWatch throttles on a wide scan. An IAM policy
grants ce:GetCostAndUsage but not the Savings Plans read actions. An SSO token
expires mid-query. The local SQLite file cannot be opened. In five places that
failure is caught and turned into a zero, and a zero is not a missing value
here: it is the input to "idle", to "0% coverage", to "costs decreased 92%", to
"your week was $0". The tool then states it with no marker and full confidence.
Silence would be safe. A confident wrong number is what gets a live NAT gateway
deleted, a twelve month Savings Plan bought, and a $0 week posted to a team
channel.

The seam is the provider boundary and the storage boundary, never the function
under test. The fakes below are boto3 shaped clients raising the errors AWS
actually raises, a connector that fails the way an expired token fails, a real
SQLite file that genuinely cannot be opened, and Slack faked at the HTTP POST.
Everything between those boundaries is nable's real code: the detector loops,
the trust envelope classification, the recommendation builder, the period diff,
the Block Kit renderer that produces the literal sentence a customer reads.

Each test says in its docstring whether it fails today because the bug is real,
or passes today as a pin on behaviour that must not regress. The pins are here
on purpose. Three of these detectors have a correct sibling a few hundred lines
away in the same file, and the pin is what turns that asymmetry into a test
failure instead of a code reading exercise, and what stops a fix from being
"make the detector never fire".
