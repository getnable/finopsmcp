"""Day-one anomaly baselines.

The detector needs 7 days of snapshot history, so a fresh install's flagship
spike detection is empty for a week, exactly while the user decides whether
nable is worth keeping. Cost Explorer already holds months of daily per-service
history, so we backfill the baseline from CE in one call and anomalies work on
day one.

Idempotent (store_snapshots upserts per provider/service/account/date) and
self-limiting: it runs only when the existing history is thinner than the
detector's minimum, so an instance with a real snapshot habit never re-pulls.
One CE call per run (about $0.01 of AWS API cost, roughly the same as the daily
snapshot job itself).
