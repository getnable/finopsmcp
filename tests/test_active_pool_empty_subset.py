"""Regression test for a real bug found while testing the duplicate-capability
scanner: server._active(subset) used `subset or _ALL_CONNECTORS`, so an
explicitly-computed EMPTY dict (falsy in Python) was treated the same as "no
subset given" and silently fell back to every connector. That made
get_cost_summary(provider="typo'd-name") silently return everyone's spend
instead of an error, since {provider: ...} if provider in _ALL_CONNECTORS
else {} produces {} for an invalid name. Only a real None must fall back.
