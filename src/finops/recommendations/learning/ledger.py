"""
The lesson ledger: every learned adjustment as a durable, reversible object.

customer_signal() recomputes verdicts live from the recommendations ledger, so
on its own the learning is invisible and silent: a source crosses WARM_FLOOR,
gets suppressed, and nobody can point at when that happened, on what evidence,
or turn it off. This module records each verdict transition (and the approval
floor) as a lesson: the human sentence, the evidence snapshot at the moment it
was learned, and a customer-controlled status.

Three guarantees, in order of importance:

  1. Nothing here mutates detectors or policy. A lesson describes an adjustment
     the signal already computed; rolling it back pins that key to NEUTRAL
     (standard ranking), never to some third behaviour.
  2. A rollback is standing. sync_lessons() never re-creates a lesson for a
     rolled-back key, however loudly the signal argues, until the customer
     restores it. A learning system that re-learns what you told it to forget
     is not under your control.
  3. Every lesson carries its evidence. A row with an empty evidence snapshot
     is a bug, and the tests treat it as one.

Deterministic, single-tenant, propose-only: this reads and writes only this
install's own DB and changes only what the customer sees and in what order.
