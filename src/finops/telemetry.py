"""
nable anonymous telemetry — OPT-IN. Nothing is sent unless you switch it on.

What we collect (and only this):
  - A random install ID (UUID4, generated once, stored locally — never your email or keys)
  - Date of the ping (day-level granularity only)
  - Which MCP tools were invoked (feature names, not query content)
  - Number of connected providers (count only, not which accounts)
  - Plan tier: free | trial | pro
  - Which nable version you are running, your Python MAJOR.MINOR (e.g. "3.12"),
    how nable was installed (uvx | pipx | venv | docker | system), and your OS
    family (e.g. "darwin"). Never the install path: it contains your home
    directory and usually your name, so only the one-word classification is sent.

Why that last line exists: a cohort on Python 3.10 got a five-week-old build
that crashed on import, and it was invisible for two months because no event
carried a version or an interpreter. A tool that cannot see which of its own
builds is running cannot tell a quiet outage from low demand.

What we never collect:
  - Cloud account IDs, ARNs, or credentials
  - Cost figures or billing data
  - IP addresses (PostHog is configured to drop them server-side)
  - Email addresses (unless you've identified yourself via the website)

How to turn it ON (it is off by default):
  export NABLE_TELEMETRY=1

How to guarantee it stays off, even if something else sets the above:
  export NABLE_NO_TELEMETRY=1

Flipped to opt-in on 2026-08-08. This runs on an operator's own machine against
their own cloud account, and the people most likely to install it are the least
willing to have it phone home by default. The cost is ours to carry: field
diagnosis gets harder, and a month of scan failures was already invisible partly
because events carried too little. Better than a default nobody agreed to.

# Telemetry became opt-in on 2026-08-08 (0.8.210) and the trade was deliberate:
# "is telemetry off by default" is a question this product has to be able to
# answer yes to. The cost was not deliberate, because nobody measured it.
# Measured 2026-08-15: ZERO events have ever arrived from 0.8.210 or later,
# while PyPI served 86-630 downloads a day straight through the change. The
# switch did not reduce the signal, it ended it. Every number we have describes
# builds <= 0.8.209, and "no scan has completed since 08-07" turned out to be
# the measurement going dark on 08-08 rather than anything about the product.
#
# Setting an environment variable is not a realistic ask. Asking once, in
# words, is. The promise survives intact: nothing is sent unless the user says
# yes, NABLE_NO_TELEMETRY still hard-overrides, and the honest answer to "is it
# off by default" is still yes.
#
# The prompt also does a second job for free. Only an interactive human can
# answer it. A package-analysis sandbox or a container has no TTY, never sees
# it, and stays silent, which is most of the robot-versus-customer problem
# solved without a classifier: 19 "machines" in 36 hours on 2026-08-14 were one
# per released version, three runs each, seconds apart, never returning.

    stdio server (wired in), a TTY means someone ran the CLI in a terminal. The
    471 machines that start nable and never call a tool are a mix of the two, and
    the fixes differ (in-client discoverability vs finishing the wizard's
    handoff), so we need to see the split.
