"""
Realized-savings measurement for verified recommendations.

A verifier (verifiers.py) answers "did the change actually happen?". This
module answers the harder question: "what is the change actually worth?"
It prices a confirmed change on the best data available, in strict order:

  1. bill_measured   CUR before/after: the resource's real unblended cost in
                     the window before the change vs after it settled. This is
                     money measured off the bill, not an estimate.
  2. effective_rate  The type-delta estimate adjusted to the customer's
                     measured effective rate (EDP/private pricing + commitment
                     coverage), the same basis the recommendation side uses.
  3. list_price      The public on-demand delta. Last resort, clearly labeled.

The returned basis is persisted on the row (verified_basis) so the ledger and
the quality signal can distinguish "measured off your bill" from "estimated".
