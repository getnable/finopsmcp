"""Suite-wide guards.

The OS keychain is per-macOS-user, not per-$HOME or per-FINOPS_DATA_DIR, so any
test that reaches the real `keyring` module reads (and on first-run generation,
rewrites) the developer's actual keychain. On macOS that is a password dialog
per suite run, and a rewrite resets the item ACL so "Always Allow" never sticks.
This is exactly how `test_setup_scan.py`'s Vault.default() calls turned every
pytest run into a keychain prompt.

Every test gets an in-memory keyring stub. Tests that assert keyring behavior
(test_keychain_prompts.py, test_keyring_cache.py) install their own counting
stubs on top via monkeypatch, which override this one for their duration.
