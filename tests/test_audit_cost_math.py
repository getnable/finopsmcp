"""Regression tests for the cost-math defects confirmed in the 2026-08-11 audit.

Why this file exists, stated plainly: nable's promise is that the dollar figure
it prints is the dollar figure the customer would actually get. Nine confirmed
findings in that audit were arithmetic, not plumbing. A total summed over the
top 50 rows and labelled the account total. A saving banked at list price
because a tier read a field name that does not exist. Three mutually exclusive
proposals on one instance adding to 156% of what the instance costs. One
unpriced Aurora Serverless v2 instance taking the whole `nable scan` down with a
TypeError. None of these break CI. They print a number, and the number is wrong,
which is the only failure mode that costs trust rather than uptime.

Where the seams are. Nothing below replaces the function under test. The fakes
sit at the provider boundary and use the shapes the APIs document: a boto3
Session and boto3.client whose rds/cloudwatch/elbv2/ce clients answer with real
response shapes, the row list Athena hands back for a query, cost_snapshots rows
written into a real SQLite database, and the scanner functions run_full_cost_audit
fans out to. Everything between that boundary and the printed dollar figure is
our code: the detectors, the dedup, the sort, the aggregation, the critique, the
rate arithmetic, the evidence split, the scorecard.

Two kinds of test live here, and each docstring says which it is:
  - "Fails today" reproduces a live defect. Red is the correct result until the
    fix lands. Do not weaken one to go green.
  - "Invariant" would pass today and goes red only if someone breaks the rule.

No network, no credentials, no Cost Explorer, no Athena, no LLM.

    This test's MECHANISM changed when the finding was fixed, and the reason is
    worth recording, because "the test told me to do X" is a bad reason to do X
    when X provably does not work.

    As written, it required each literal to BE a Cost Explorer name. Measured
    against the CE shapes this file already seeds, that prescription fails twice:

        daily_costs keys, as CE returns them:
          "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute"        $27,000/mo
          "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Data Transfer"   $1,200/mo

        literal "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute" -> $27,000 of $28,200

    CE splits a service across usage-type suffixes, so an exact-match literal is
    either wrong or incomplete, and a pattern asking what EC2 costs means all of
    it. Writing the long name into six call sites would also have restored the
    duplication that let these drift out of date unnoticed in the first place.

    So the lookup resolves instead: patterns keep asking for a short readable
    name and PatternContext.service_series maps it through the repo's existing
    alias map and sums every matching CE bucket. The invariant is unchanged and
    slightly stronger: every literal must RESOLVE, and a name that cannot be
    resolved is a bug rather than a silent $0.

    The vacuity guard below is the load-bearing part. An invariant expressed as
