"""Asking once, in words, instead of requiring an environment variable.

Why this exists, measured 2026-08-15: telemetry went opt-in on 2026-08-08 in
0.8.210, gated on NABLE_TELEMETRY, and ZERO events have arrived from 0.8.210 or
later since. Not fewer. None. PyPI served 86-630 downloads a day straight
through the change, so the package was being installed the whole time and simply
stopped reporting. Every number we still have describes builds <= 0.8.209, and
what looked like "no scan has completed since 08-07" was the measurement going
dark on 08-08.

The opt-in decision was right and stays. Requiring an env var to express it was
the part that failed, because approximately nobody sets one.

The prompt does a second job the funnel needs. On 2026-08-14, 19 "machines"
appeared in 36 hours: one per released version, 0.8.201 through 0.8.209 in
order, three scans each seconds apart, five running a whole wizard-to-heartbeat
sequence in under a minute, none ever seen again. That is a harness walking the
release history, and in the data it is indistinguishable from 19 people having a
terrible first day. Only an interactive human can answer a prompt, so consent
sorts most of that by construction.

What these tests hold:
  - default is no, and every ambiguous answer is a no
  - asked exactly once, ever, whatever the answer
  - never asked where a prompt would hang or corrupt a stream
  - the promise still holds: nothing sends until someone says yes
