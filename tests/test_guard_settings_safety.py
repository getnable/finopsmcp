"""`nable guard install` writes to a file the user did not give us: their
Claude Code settings.json. That file may already hold hooks from other tools,
their model choice, their permissions. The bar is not "usually works".

Every test here is a state a real machine can be in. The invariant in all of
them is the same: either we make the intended change, or we change *nothing*
and say why. Never a partial write, never a repair we guessed at, never a
traceback that reads as "nable is broken" when the fix is one chmod.

Found by stress-testing the install path before the Product Hunt launch: a
top-level JSON array and a `"hooks": null` both parsed fine and then raised a
raw AttributeError from inside setdefault.
