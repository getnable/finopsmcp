Version-pin + finops upgrade tests.

The footgun: configs that launch `uvx finops-mcp` unpinned re-resolve "latest"
on the first cold start after every PyPI release, which can blow past Claude
Desktop's startup timeout ("Server disconnected"). The fix: the wizard writes
a pinned `finops-mcp==X`, and `finops upgrade` moves the pin deliberately,
warming the cache outside any client startup window.
