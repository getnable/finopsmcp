    Agent-driven onboarding: what is connected, what credentials are already on
    this machine, and the exact command to connect each remaining provider.

    Call this when the user asks to connect a provider, says setup is incomplete,
    or asks what they are missing. Detected ambient credentials (gcloud login,
    env keys, ~/.modal.toml) mean the connect is ONE terminal command with no
    secrets involved; run it for the user or hand them the command.

    Rules for the agent, and they are hard rules:
      - NEVER ask the user to paste an API key or secret into the chat. For
        paste-a-key providers, have them run the setup command in their own
        terminal; it deep-links the key page and stores the key locally.
      - Prefer the zero-secret paths: `finops connect` (batch-connects everything
        detected) and `finops setup gcp` / ambient AWS, where no secret ever
        passes through the conversation.

    Examples:
        - "Connect my GCP costs"
        - "What providers am I missing?"
        - "Finish setting up nable"
