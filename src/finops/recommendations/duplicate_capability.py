"""
Duplicate-capability scanner.

A cost breakdown by service tells you WHAT you spend on, but not whether two
services are doing the same job and you're paying for both. Every line item
looks legitimate on its own, so a plain bill breakdown never surfaces this;
you have to already suspect it and go looking. This scanner looks for spend
patterns where multiple connected providers or AWS services serve the same
underlying capability at once.

V1 covers three clusters, chosen for the lowest false-positive risk available:
  - LLM inference paths: 2+ of {Bedrock, direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex,
    OpenRouter, LiteLLM, Together, Replicate, Modal} carrying real spend at
    once usually means one is a leftover from testing or a migration that
    never got cleaned up, not a deliberate multi-provider setup.
  - Managed search/retrieval: 2+ of {Kendra, OpenSearch Service} carrying AWS
    spend at once.
  - Data platform / lakehouse: Databricks and Snowflake both carrying real
    spend at once. Increasingly overlapping (Databricks SQL warehouses vs.
    Snowflake, Snowpark vs. Spark), and one of the most common real-world
    "do we actually need both" stories in FinOps, though team-by-team
    platform choice is common enough that this stays a flag, not a claim.

Deliberately NOT covered yet: overlapping database engines (RDS + DocumentDB,
etc). Multi-database architectures are extremely often intentional, different
data models for different workloads, so a same-purpose-engine detector there
would be wrong more often than right. Skip rather than ship a noisy finding.
