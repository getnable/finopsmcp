"""Additive migrations must work on PostgreSQL, not just SQLite.

The bug this locks down: detection used `PRAGMA table_info`, which is SQLite-only.
On a shared-team Postgres deployment it raised, the exception was swallowed as a
warning, and the ALTER never ran. `metadata.create_all` does not compensate, since
it creates missing TABLES and never missing columns on a table that already
exists. So every column added to the migration list after a Postgres database was
first created stayed missing, and any query naming it failed with an
undefined-column error.

Compounding it, the DDL was hand-written with SQLite type names: `DATETIME` and
`REAL` are not PostgreSQL types, so even with working detection the ALTER would
have been a syntax error.

No Postgres server is needed here. SQLAlchemy can compile DDL for a dialect
without connecting, which is exactly the layer both bugs lived at.
