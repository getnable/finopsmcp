"""Evidence classification for the AWS deep-audit findings.

`analyzers/waste.py` predates `recommendations/envelope.py`, so its ~24 detectors
ship a precise `estimated_monthly_savings` on every finding regardless of how much
we actually know. Some of those numbers are solid (an unattached EBS volume at a
known size, a Compute Optimizer finding). Others are a CPU heuristic priced at list
rate, which is a guess wearing a dollar sign.

This module puts the existing envelope rule, evidence decides the claim, over those
findings WITHOUT rewriting the detectors:

  measured -> "recommendation". We observed the resource state or read a real
              metric, and the price follows from it. The figure stands.
  inferred  -> "investigation". A proxy, a single-signal heuristic, or a price we
              assumed. We keep the internal number for ranking but tell the caller
              why we are unsure and how to confirm it.

Deliberately ADDITIVE. `estimated_monthly_savings` stays on every finding because
_dedup_findings ranks on it and the savings ledger reads it. The honesty happens in
what we *say*: `evidence`, `kind`, `why_unsure`, `confirm_steps`, and a headline
that splits measured savings from unconfirmed opportunity instead of adding them
into one number nobody believes.

Adding a detector without classifying it fails `test_waste_evidence.py`, so the map
cannot silently rot.
