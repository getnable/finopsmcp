"""Opt-in gate for outward remediation: whether nable may open PRs in a repo.

This is a coarse kill-switch, distinct from the advisory action gate in
``policy.py`` (which classifies a proposed action as allow/block/escalate). This
answers a blunter question a security team asks: "is nable permitted to push a
branch and open a pull request in our repositories at all?"

Default is OFF. nable is propose-only, but "propose" here means writing to the
customer's source repo, so an enterprise should be able to assert the restriction
as declared config, not rely on the absence of a GitHub token. dry-run (diff only)
and patch-only (local files, no git) paths are never gated by this: they touch
nothing outside the box.

Enable with either:
  - FINOPS_REMEDIATION_ENABLED=true            (env, mirrors FINOPS_CLEANUP_ENABLED)
  - remediation.open_prs: true  in nable.policy.yaml   (policy-as-code, when present)

The policy file is read from FINOPS_POLICY_FILE when set, else from the nable
data directory. Never from the working directory: MCP clients start the server
inside whatever project is open, so a repo could ship a policy that turns this
gate on for itself.
