    Guide connecting Azure while keeping the service-principal secret off the model.

    Azure has no local credentials nable can safely auto-detect, so connecting
    needs a client secret. Unlike connect_aws and connect_gcp (which read
    credentials already on the machine, so nothing sensitive passes through this
    conversation), an Azure secret would have to be pasted into the chat to reach
    a tool argument, which routes it through the model provider. nable does not do
    that. This tool returns the Cloud Shell script and has you finish the connect
    in your OWN terminal with `finops setup azure`, which encrypts the secret into
    your local vault. The model never sees the secret.

    Examples:
        - "Connect Azure"
        - "How do I connect my Azure subscription?"
