    Pull Google's native Recommender API cost recommendations for your GCP projects.

    This is the deeper, GCP-native counterpart to audit_gcp_waste. Instead of

    Recommender API, which runs ML on 8+ days of real usage and prices savings
    against your actual SKU rates (including committed-use discounts already in
    effect). It covers what the scanner can't: machine-type rightsizing,
    committed-use-discount purchases, Cloud SQL idle/overprovisioned, Cloud Run
    tuning, plus idle VMs/disks/IPs/images. Findings come back sorted by monthly
    savings and wrapped in the same trust envelope (measured -> recommendation,
    inferred -> investigation).
