License validation for nable (finops-mcp).

Tiers
─────
free         Permanent. ~90% of the platform. No key required.
             Cost queries, anomaly detection, rightsizing, PR comments,
             Slack/Teams alerts, all connectors, snapshots, attribution.

trial        7 days of full Pro access from first install. Kicks in
             automatically when no key is set. Uses the same dual-store
             (OS keyring + file) so deleting one source can't reset it.

pro          Full access. Unlocked by a signed license key.
             Adds: ticket auto-creation, scheduled email digests,
             commitment purchase recommendations, multi-team org reports.

Key format:  FINOPS-2-{b64_payload}-{b64_ed25519_sig}   (current)
             FINOPS-1-{b64_payload}-{b64_hmac}           (retired: the v1 HMAC secret
             leaked in public git history, so v1 keys are forgeable and never accepted)
  payload:   base64url(json: {"e": email, "d": issued_YYYYMMDD, "p": "pro"})
  v2 sig:    Ed25519(private_key, "2:" + b64_payload). Clients verify with the
             bundled public key — no shared secret, and keys cannot be forged.
  v1 sig:    HMAC-SHA256(_SECRET, "1:" + b64_payload). Needs the secret on the
             client to verify; kept only for backward compatibility.
